## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am an engineer focused on cloud infrastructure and application development. I value understanding the underlying principles of technology choices and implementations, always considering the "why" behind technical decisions.

From designing and implementing cloud environments to developing user-friendly applications with high maintainability, I strive to understand the essence of technologies to deliver thoughtful engineering solutions.
